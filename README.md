# Full Stack Frameworks with Django MileStone(Project4) : 8Bear

8Bear is a website for the food industry and consumers in Singapore. The current food delivery systems and companies draw up to 30% commission or more from vendors who user their services to connect to customers.
8Bear offers a platform for food vendors to take charge of the delivery themselves and cater their foods for certain towns or postal codes. Their customers can order their food from home through this website and
vendors can read the orders from their order view page.  

My deployed website is [here](https://nks-8bear.herokuapp.com/).

The project looks fine across different browsers like edge, chrome or firefox. I am using chrome primarily most of the time when debugging.
In smaller devices, I have reduce the columns in the tables in "My recipes page" & "Recipes page" so that the table of content will generally be confined in the constraint of the device width.
Due to associating most of the primary tags with bootstrap CSS, hence the contents mobile responsives are pretty much organised and set by bootstrap already.
